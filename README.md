## LIBRARY_E-GATE

Library E-Gate is a Web-based application project that stores students' and instructors' check-in and check-out times at Amrita School of Arts and Science College in Kochi. Based on this information, the librarian can prepare a monthly or semester-by-semester report. When entering and exiting the library, the user must scan their ID card.
